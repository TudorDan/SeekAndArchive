# Assignment: Searching for a file

## Task

* Create an application which watches a selected group of files, and automatically creates a compressed archive 
of them when any of them changes.

* Let the application have two command arguments: the first is the file we are looking for, and the second is 
the directory we must perform the recursive searching.

* As an output, list the path of the files found matching the name.
